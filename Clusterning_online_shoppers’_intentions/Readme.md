Clustering Evaluation using Clusteval
This project uses the clusteval package, a Python library for clustering evaluation, to perform clustering on a dataset and visualize the results. The package provides a range of evaluation metrics, clustering algorithms, and linkage methods to explore different clustering configurations.



Dataset
